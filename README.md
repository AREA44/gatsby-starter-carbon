# Gatsby Starter Carbon

## What is this?

> This is a starter-kit (boilerplate) with a dependancy on the `gatsby-theme-carbon`
> package. The primary goal of `gatsby-theme-carbon` is to get content authors
> speaking the IBM Design Language with Carbon as soon as possible. It includes
> some sample components/content demos in the `src/pages` directory.
